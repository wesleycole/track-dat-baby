				<p>
					Welcome to <strong>{emoji("ðŸ‘¶")} Track Dat Baby!</strong>, a
					new and easy tracking system for your little boo bear.
				</p>
				<p>
					Track Dat Baby(TDB) came about because I had a baby, well my
					wife did and I watched {emoji("ðŸ™ˆ")}. Anyway, we needed to
					track all of the poops, pees, and feedings because we
					couldn't ever remember that stuff, so Track Dat Baby was
					born (pun intended).
				</p>
				<p>
					TDB is a fairly simple app. My wife and I didn't need a ton
					of functionality, so we are just tracking the minimal for
					right now. I'll hopefully add more features based on
					requests.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's enough from me, I would really appreciate it if you
					would give TDB a try and start tracking dat baby!
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>A fellow sleep deprived but happy parent,</em>
					<br />
					<strong>Wes Cole</strong>
